# ns-serve
Tiniest Nodejs Static Server without npm dependencies.

Great to run static websites

# Install

  npm i -g ns-serve
`


# Usage
Go to any static web project, open you command line in that folder and run `ns-serve`, open you web browser and type http://localhost:8080

# Limitation
* As the name states, it's a static server.
* Directory paths shows an error page.
* If port 8080 is in use, server will fail to start.
